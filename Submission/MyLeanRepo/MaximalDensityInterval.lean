# Maximal Density Interval

Finds an interval `[x₀, x₀+r₀]` maximizing the density ratio
`μ(I) / r^(κ/2)` among all intervals with `δ ≤ r ≤ 1` contained in `[0,1]`.

Provides:
- `measure_interval_usc`: upper semicontinuity of interval measure
- `maximal_density_interval_C`: generalized version with arbitrary Frostman constant C
- `maximal_density_interval`: corollary setting `C = δ^(-ε)`

/-- Generalized maximal density interval for arbitrary Frostman constant C.

Among all intervals `[a, a+r]` with `δ ≤ r ≤ 1` contained in `[0,1]`, find one
`I₀ = [x₀, x₀+r₀]` maximizing the density ratio `μ(I) / r^(κ/2)`.

The maximizer satisfies:
- `δ ≤ r₀ ≤ 1`
- `μ(I₀) > 0`
- `r₀ ≥ C^(-2/κ)` (lower bound from Frostman vs. density)
- Every subinterval `J ⊆ I₀` of length `r ≥ δ` has
  `μ(J) ≤ μ(I₀) · (r/r₀)^(κ/2)` (self-similarity / near-Frostman at exponent κ/2)
