# Energy to Large-Mass Delta-Set Extraction

Given a probability measure ν on a finite δ-separated subset of ℝ with bounded
(2κ)-energy, extract a subset S that is an `IsRealDeltaSet` with exponent κ' < κ
and retains at least 3/4 of the original mass.

Uses multi-level weight decomposition to avoid the mass loss from thinning.

If S is δ-separated, all atomic weights w(a) lie in [m, 2m), and μ is a Frostman
measure with constant C supported on S, then the number of points of S in any
ball of radius r is bounded by (2C/W) * |S| * r^τ, where W is the total weight. -/
