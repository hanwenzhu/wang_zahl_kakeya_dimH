# Weighted graph area formula on an open domain

The global weighted graph-area formula extends to functions that are C¹ only
on an open set, provided the measured base set is contained in that domain.
The proof exhausts the open set by compact subsets and uses smooth cutoffs to
construct global C¹ extensions on the disjoint exhaustion pieces.
