# Absolute continuity of the graph pullback measure

For a globally C¹ function `g : R² → R`, the pullback of ambient Hausdorff
2-measure along the graph embedding is absolutely continuous with respect to
Lebesgue measure on R².

## Proof

Use a σ-compact exhaustion of R² by closed balls. On each compact ball, the
graph map is Lipschitz (since it is globally C¹, hence locally Lipschitz).
If `E` has Lebesgue measure zero, then on each compact `K_n`:

`μH[2](graphMap g '' (E ∩ K_n)) ≤ C_n² · μH[2](E ∩ K_n) = C_n² · planeConstant · volume(E ∩ K_n) = 0`

Summing over the countable exhaustion gives `graphPullbackMeasure g E = 0`.
