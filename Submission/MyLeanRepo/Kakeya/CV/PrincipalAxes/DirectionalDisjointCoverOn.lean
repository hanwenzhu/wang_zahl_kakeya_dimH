# Measurable disjoint cover additivity on a measurable subset

Generalization of `direction_i_measurable_cover_additivity`: the same countable
cover identity, but restricted to an arbitrary measurable set `S`.  The
disjointified patches are intersected with `S` before summing.

/-- Given a countable cover by coordinate-permuted regular graph patches and a
measurable set `S`, disjointify the patches intersected with `S` and sum the
per-patch directional surface-area identities. -/
