# Connection between homothetic closeness and shape closeness

## Convention

The shape space parameter `B` corresponds to the ellipsoid
`ellipsoid c B.symm = c + B.symm '' ball`.  This is because
`ShapeClose β B₁ B₂` bounds `‖B₂ ∘ B₁⁻¹‖`, which controls the inclusion
`B₁⁻¹ '' ball ⊆ β • B₂⁻¹ '' ball`.

## Main results

- `shapeClose_imp_homothety`: `ShapeClose β B₁ B₂` implies
  `AreHomotheticallyClose β (ellipsoid c B₁.symm) (ellipsoid c B₂.symm)`.
- `homothetyAt_imp_shapeClose`: converse for centered ellipsoids at 0.

/-- If `B₁`, `B₂` are β-close in shape, then the ellipsoids with linear
parameters `B₁.symm`, `B₂.symm` and the same center are β-homothetically close.

The center of dilation is the common center `c`. -/
