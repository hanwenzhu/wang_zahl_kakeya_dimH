# BV Compactness for Sequences via Translation Continuity

Sequence version of BV compactness: given a sequence of measurable sets
with uniform volume bounds and uniform translation continuity on compact
sets, extract an L¹_loc-convergent subsequence.

This is the form needed by the blow-up lemma.

## Main result

- `bv_compactness_sequence_of_translation`: sequence version

## Proof route

Same ball-average mollification + diagonal extraction pipeline as
`bv_compactness_of_translation`, but applied to an arbitrary sequence
rather than a continuous family indexed by `r : ℝ`.

/-- **BV compactness for indicator sequences** (via translation continuity).

Given a sequence `E_k` of measurable sets with uniform volume bounds and
uniform translation continuity on every compact set, there exists a
measurable set `F` and a strictly increasing `subseq` such that
`E_{subseq k} → F` in L¹_loc (symmetric difference volume → 0 on every
compact set). -/
