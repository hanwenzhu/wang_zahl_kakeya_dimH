# 1D L¹-L∞ Duality for Continuous Functions

For a continuous compactly supported scalar function `f`,
`∫ |f| = sup { |∫ f · φ| : φ smooth, compactly supported, |φ| ≤ 1 }`.

We prove the non-trivial direction: for any `ε > 0`, there exists smooth
compactly supported `φ` with `|φ| ≤ 1` and `∫ f · φ ≥ ∫ |f| - ε`.

For continuous compactly supported `f` and `ε > 0`,

`|φ_ε| ≤ 1`, and `∫ f · φ_ε ≥ ∫ |f| - ε · μ(tsupport f)`. -/
