# Regularization Lemma

Given a bounded measurable set `B` with finite `(n-1)`-Hausdorff measure
of its frontier, construct a regular open set `U = interior(closure B)` such that:
1. `U` is open and bounded
2. `volume U = volume B`
3. `μHE[n-1](frontier U) ≤ μHE[n-1](frontier B)`

This removes "slits" and "hairs" that cause Minkowski content bounds to fail.
