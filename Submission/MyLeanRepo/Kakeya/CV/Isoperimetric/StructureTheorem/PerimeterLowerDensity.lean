# Perimeter Lower Density at Reduced Boundary Points

At a reduced boundary point `x` with normal `ν`, the local perimeter has positive
lower density: `P(U; B(x,r)) ≥ c · r^(n-1)` for small `r`.

This is an **unconditional** result derived directly from `ReducedBoundaryData`
via the Gauss-Green cutoff and blow-up convergence. It does not require
perimeter measure density bounds or Besicovitch differentiation.

## Main theorem

`perimeter_lower_density_from_data`:
Given `ReducedBoundaryData U x ν`, there exist `c > 0` and `r0 > 0` such that
for all `0 < r < r0`,
`perimeterIn U (ball x r) ≥ c · r^(n-1)`.

## Proof (Gauss-Green cutoff)

1. Choose radial cutoff `φ = radialCutoff 0 (1/2) (1/2)`, supported in `B(0,1)`.
2. The directional derivative `f(z) := fderiv φ z ν` is non-negative on the
   half-space `Hν = {inner z ν < 0}` and strictly positive on an open subset,
   so `I_H := ∫_{Hν} f > 0`.
3. By the blow-up lemma, `∫_{blowUp U x r} f → I_H` as `r → 0`.
4. Define test vector field `Φ_r(y) := φ((y-x)/r) • ν`, supported in `B(x,r)`.
5. `divergence Φ_r = (1/r) · f((y-x)/r)`, and change of variables gives
   `∫_U divergence Φ_r = r^(n-1) · ∫_{blowUp U x r} f`.
6. For small `r`, this is `≥ r^(n-1) · I_H / 2`.
7. By definition of `perimeterIn`, `P(U; B(x,r)) ≥ |∫_U divergence Φ_r|`.

/-- **Perimeter lower density from reduced boundary data**.

At a reduced boundary point `x` with normal `ν`, there exist `c > 0` and `r0 > 0`
such that for all `0 < r < r0`,
`perimeterIn U (ball x r) ≥ c · r^(n-1)`.

This is proved directly from `ReducedBoundaryData` via the Gauss-Green cutoff
and blow-up convergence, without assuming perimeter measure density bounds. -/
