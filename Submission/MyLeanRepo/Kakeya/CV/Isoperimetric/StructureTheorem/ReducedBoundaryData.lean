# Reduced Boundary Data and Blow-Up Lemma Assembly

Defines `ReducedBoundaryData` — the explicit GMT assumptions needed at a
reduced boundary point — and proves `reduced_boundary_blowup_data`
conditional on these assumptions plus the half-space characterization lemma.

## Main definitions

- `ReducedBoundaryData S x ν`: bundles the key properties at a reduced
  boundary point: blow-up bounds, directional variation vanishing,
  half-ball density, and orientation.

## Main results

- `halfspace_identification`: zero directional variation + orientation +
  half-ball density → F is a.e. the half-space `{inner y ν < 0}`
- `reduced_boundary_blowup_data`: all blow-up data needed for the
  blow-up lemma, proved from `ReducedBoundaryData`

/-- **Bridge: weak orientation implies strong orientation**.

If a measurable set `F` satisfies the orientation inequality for all
nonnegative smooth compactly supported test functions `φ` with `φ 0 > 0`,
then it satisfies the inequality for ALL nonnegative smooth compactly
supported test functions.

Proof: for `φ` with `φ 0 = 0`, approximate by `φ_ε = φ + ε·η` where `η`
is a fixed smooth bump with `η 0 = 1`. The inequality is linear in `φ`,
so taking `ε → 0+` recovers the result for `φ`. -/
