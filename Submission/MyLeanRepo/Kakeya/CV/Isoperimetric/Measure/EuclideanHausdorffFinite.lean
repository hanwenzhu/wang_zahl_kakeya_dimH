# Euclidean Hausdorff Measure Utilities

Basic facts about `μHE[d]` (Euclidean Hausdorff measure) and its relation
to `μH[d]` (standard Hausdorff measure).

## Main results
- `euclideanHausdorffMeasure_finite_iff`: `μHE[d] S < ⊤ ↔ μH[d] S < ⊤`

/-- Equivalence between finiteness of Euclidean Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff measure.

Since `μHE[d] = c • μH[d]` with `0 < c < ∞`, we have `μHE[d] S < ⊤ ↔ μH[d] S < ⊤`. -/
