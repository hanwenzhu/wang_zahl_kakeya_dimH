# Stability of same-colour ellipsoid selection

Carbery--Valdimarsson Lemma 10, isolating the continuity argument used in the
antipodal separation step.

## Proof outline

The proof chains homothetic closeness relations:

1. `AreHomotheticallyCloseAt.symm`: if `A` is α-close to `B`, then `B` is α-close to `A`
   (for `α ≠ 0`). Proved by applying the inverse dilation to both inclusions.

2. `AreHomotheticallyCloseAt.trans`: if `A` is α-close to `B` and `B` is β-close to `C`,
   then `A` is (αβ)-close to `C`. Proved using `dilateAbout_comp`.

3. Main chain: for eventually all `m`,
   `Eseq m` ↔ `Kseq m` ↔ `K` ↔ `E` with factors α, α, α,
   yielding α³-closeness of `Eseq m` to `E`.

4. The net's α³-separation hypothesis for same-colour ellipsoids gives equality.
