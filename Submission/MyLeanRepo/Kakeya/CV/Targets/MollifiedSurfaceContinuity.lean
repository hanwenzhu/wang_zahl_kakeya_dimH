# Continuity of the coefficient-space mollifier

Analytic infrastructure for the mollified directional surface area used in
Carbery--Valdimarsson Section 3.

## Proof outline

For fixed `x₀`, apply the filter version of the dominated convergence theorem
to `F x := indicator (ball x ε) f`.

1. For `x` near `x₀`, `F x` is `AEStronglyMeasurable` because `f` is locally
   integrable and `ball x ε` is measurable.
2. The family is dominated by `indicator (closedBall x₀ (ε+1)) ‖f‖`, which is
   integrable since `f` is locally integrable and the closed ball is compact.
3. For a.e. `y` (outside the sphere `sphere x₀ ε`, which has measure zero),
   `x ↦ F x y` is eventually constant near `x₀`, hence continuous.
4. DCT gives continuity of `x ↦ ∫ y, F x y ∂volume = ∫ y in ball x ε, f y`.
5. `ballAverage ε f` is a constant multiple of this map.
