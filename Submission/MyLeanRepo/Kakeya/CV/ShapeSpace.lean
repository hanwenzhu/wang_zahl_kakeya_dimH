# Shape space for ellipsoid colouring

Centered ellipsoids in `Point 3` are identified with invertible linear maps
`A : Point 3 ≃ₗ[ℝ] Point 3`.  This module defines a closeness relation
`ShapeClose β A₁ A₂` and proves the structural properties needed for the
graph-colouring argument of Carbery--Valdimarsson Lemma 8.
