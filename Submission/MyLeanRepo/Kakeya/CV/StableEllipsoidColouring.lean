# Stable finite-colour ellipsoid net

Strengthens the CV Lemma 8 interface with the `α³` same-colour separation
margin consumed by the selection-stability argument.

## Proof outline

1. Choose `β = 2` for the shape net separation parameter.
2. Let `α = √3 * β`. The Auerbach construction gives a `√3`-close ellipsoid
   at 0, and the shape net gives a `β`-close shape, so by transitivity the
   palette ellipsoid is `α`-close to the body.
3. Let `γ = α³` be the conflict parameter. Since `β ≤ γ`, the conflict graph
   on the shape net has bounded degree and admits a finite proper colouring.
4. The net consists of centered ellipsoids `(0, B.symm)` for `B ∈ shapeNet β`.
5. For separation: if two same-colour palette ellipsoids are `α³`-close at 0,
   then `homothetyAt_imp_shapeClose` gives `ShapeClose α³` of their inverse
   shapes, which is a conflict in the graph. A proper colouring then forces
   the shapes to be equal.
