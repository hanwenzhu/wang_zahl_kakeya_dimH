# Square factor extraction for non-squarefree polynomials

This module proves that every nonzero, non-squarefree polynomial of total degree
at most `k` in three variables over `ℝ` can be written as `q^2 * r` where `q` is
nonconstant and `deg(q) ≤ k/2`.

This is a key step in the generic polynomial regularity argument: the
non-squarefree locus is contained in the union of images of polynomial maps
from lower-dimensional coefficient spaces.

/-- If a nonzero polynomial `p` of total degree at most `k` is not squarefree,
then it has a nonconstant square factor `q^2` with `deg(q) ≤ k/2`. -/
