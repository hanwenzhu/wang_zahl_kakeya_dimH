# Ball containment for tube-infinite-cylinder intersection

Geometric lemma: the portion of a δ-tube U lying inside the infinite cylinder
of radius r around T's axis is contained in one ball of radius
`2δ + π*(r+3δ)/(2σ)`, when the angle between T and U is in `[σ, 2σ]`.

The portion of U.carrier inside the r-cylinder around T's axis is contained
in a closed ball of radius `2*δ + π*(r+3*δ)/(2*σ)`, centered at a point
within δ of U's unit segment.
