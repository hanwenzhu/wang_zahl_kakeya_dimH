# Matrix-entry grid for near-orthogonal transformations

Constructs a finite ε-grid on 3×3 real matrices and filters to near-orthogonal
ones. Used by the tube density test net to generate oriented convex test bodies.

## Main results

- `matrixGrid`: all 3×3 matrices with entries on an ε-grid in [-2,2]
- `isNearOrthogonal`: entrywise |M^T M - I| ≤ 1/10
- `frameMatrices`: filtered grid
- `matrixGrid_card`: cardinality ≤ (11/ε)^9
- `orthogonal_matrix_cover`: every orthogonal matrix has a nearby frame matrix
- `near_orthogonal_det_bound`: 1/2 ≤ |det M| ≤ 2
