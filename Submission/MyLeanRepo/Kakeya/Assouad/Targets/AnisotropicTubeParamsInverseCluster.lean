WZ Lemma 8 rediscretization: quantitatively invert the exact affine transport
of the four vertical-chart line parameters.

The map is linear in `(a,b,c,d)`.  Writing `L = d-c`, `mid = c+L/2`,
`gmid = g(mid)`, the transformed differences are

    Δd' = (m L² / 4) Δd
    Δc' = (L / 2) (Δc + gmid Δd)
    Δb' = (m L / 2) (Δb + mid Δd)
    Δa' = Δa + gmid Δb + mid (Δc + gmid Δd)

Inverting and using `|gmid| ≤ 1`, `|mid| ≤ 1`, `m ≤ 1`, `L ≤ 1` gives
each source difference bounded by `9r / (m L²)`, well within the stated
`100r / (m L²)`.
