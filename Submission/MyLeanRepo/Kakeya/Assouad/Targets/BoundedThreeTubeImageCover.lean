WZ Lemma 8 anisotropic rediscretization: package the three-tube image cover
with the bounded-base certificate required by `IsProjectionExtremalPair`.

Given a meeting point between the axis and the extended slab, construct clipped
endpoint parameters t1, t2 that themselves lie in the extended slab.

This strengthens `axis_slab_parameter_bounds_clipped` by certifying the
z-coordinate membership of the clipped endpoints, which is needed to transfer
the source unit-ball bound to target basepoints via
`anisotropicImage_tube_axis_norm_le_two`.
