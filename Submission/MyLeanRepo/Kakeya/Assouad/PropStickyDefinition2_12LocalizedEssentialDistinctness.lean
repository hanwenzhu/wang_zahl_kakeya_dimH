# Localized ordinary essential distinctness

For ordinary unit-segment tubes whose midpoints remain in the fixed local
window, sufficiently large pairwise paper line distance rules out carrier
containment in either centered doubled parent.

A localized line-class family separated by more than the closed
centered-doubled containment loss is essentially distinct in the literal
ordinary sense of Assouad Definition 2.12.
