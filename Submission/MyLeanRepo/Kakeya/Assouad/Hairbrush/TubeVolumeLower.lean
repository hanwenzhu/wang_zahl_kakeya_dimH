# Tube volume lower bound

Every `δ`-tube has volume at least `δ²/8`.

## Proof route

The canonical tube `Metric.cthickening δ (unitSegment 0 e0)` contains the
axis-aligned box with coordinates `x₀ ∈ [1/4, 3/4]`, `x₁, x₂ ∈ [-δ/4, δ/4]`.
For any point in this box, its distance to the point `x₀ • e0` on the segment
is at most `δ/2 < δ`. The box has volume `(1/2)·(δ/2)·(δ/2) = δ²/8`.

A rigid isometry maps any tube to the canonical tube while preserving Lebesgue
volume, so the same lower bound holds for every tube.
