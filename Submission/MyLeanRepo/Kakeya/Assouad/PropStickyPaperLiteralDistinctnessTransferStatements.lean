# Essential distinctness under the literal-paper longitudinal compression

WZ Definition 5 uses the fixed map

> `(x₁, ..., xₙ) ↦ (c x₁ / rho, ..., c xₙ₋₁ / rho, c xₙ)`.

Relative to the historical target family already used by the stable CWA
infrastructure, the literal target family is obtained by compressing only the
third coordinate by `1 / 100`. The compression fixes the intersection of
every line with `z = 0`. On the actual `L₃` cone, its induced slope dilation
does not decrease the angle between positively oriented directions.

The two leaves below isolate that geometry and its finite-family consequence.

Longitudinal compression does not decrease the paper line metric when both
the source and image axes are represented by tubes in the fixed line class.
