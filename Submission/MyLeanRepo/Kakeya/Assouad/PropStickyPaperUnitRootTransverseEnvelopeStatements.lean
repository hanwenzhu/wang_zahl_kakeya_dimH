# Common convex envelope for the vertical unit-root rescaling

Relative to the fixed vertical unit root, the historical paper rescaling
preserves the longitudinal coordinate and compresses each transverse
coordinate by `1 / 100`.  Thus the inverse image of one convex target set is
a common convex source envelope with volume loss exactly `100 ^ 2 = 10000`.

This is the geometric transfer leaf only.  It does not construct an indexed
rescaled family or assert a Convex-Wolff bound.
