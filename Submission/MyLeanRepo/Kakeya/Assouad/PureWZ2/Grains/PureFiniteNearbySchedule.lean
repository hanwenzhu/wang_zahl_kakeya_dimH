# Finite representative schedule for pure nearby-scale CWA

Choose finitely many requested scales and attach the pure actual-John
witness supplied by `WZ2PaperPureCWAAtNearbyScales` at each representative.
Every requested real scale is assigned to one representative whose actual
cover scale remains inside the enlarged output window.  No historical WZ
target family is introduced.

/--
Build the pure finite schedule directly from actual-John witnesses.  The
geometric grid uses ratio `ambientConstant`; one ambient window is paid when
rounding a requested scale to the grid and a second one when taking its
nearby witness.
