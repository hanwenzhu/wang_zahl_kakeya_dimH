# Generalized direction packing for paper tube shadings

Generalizes `paper_line_distance_shared_point` from threshold `10*L`
to arbitrary `K*L`, with line-distance bound `100*K*L`.

## Key lemma

`paper_line_distance_shared_point_general`: if two paper tubes both
contain `p` and their directions have cross-product norm `< K*L`, then
their paper line-distance is `≤ 100*K*L`.
