# Direction packing for paper tube shadings

Adapts the WZ1 coarse direction packing bound to `WZ1PaperTubeShading`
using the paper line-distance metric and `tube_packing_bound_general`.

## Key lemma

`paper_line_distance_shared_point`: if two paper tubes both contain a point `p`
and their directions have cross-product norm `< 10*L`, then their paper
line-distance is `≤ 500*L`.

This reduces direction non-concentration to `tube_packing_bound_general`,
giving the universal bound `8001^5` (which fits within the stated constant
`2 * 4 * 601^3 * 12001^3`).
