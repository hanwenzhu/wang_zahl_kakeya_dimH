# Geometry of honest fine samples in one coarse parent

Different source samples need not lie on one fine tube.  It is enough that
their genuine fine tubes belong to the same frozen Section 6 parent fiber.
The paper line-cover metric then compares both samples to the same coarse
axis with an explicit scale error.
