# Direction-overlap lemma

If two unit vectors W1, W2 are both nearly perpendicular to two transverse
unit vectors u, v (with cross-product norm ≥ kappa), and they lie on the
same side of the span(u,v) plane, then W1 and W2 are close:

  ‖W1 - W2‖ ≤ 8 * eps / kappa

Proof uses the WZ1 plane-projection perturbation infrastructure: each Wi is
close to normalize(cross(u,v)), and the sign condition ensures both are on
the same side, so their mutual distance is at most twice the individual bound.

/-- Direction-overlap lemma with tight constant 6.

The actual proof gives `2 * Real.sqrt 8 * eps / kappa ≈ 5.66 * eps / kappa < 6 * eps / kappa`.
This is the key bound for the Route A Lipschitz gluing argument. -/
