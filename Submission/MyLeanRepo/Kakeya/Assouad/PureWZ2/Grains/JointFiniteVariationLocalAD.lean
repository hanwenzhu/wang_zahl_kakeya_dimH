# Joint finite iteration of plane-map variation and local AD

The plane-map and local-AD refinements cannot be selected independently: two
large independent subshadings may have empty intersection.  This module
isolates the paper-faithful interface.  At every scale one common spatial
restriction of the current shading must simultaneously preserve point
multiplicity, control plane-map variation, and establish the local AD bound.

Once such a one-scale producer is supplied, all nesting and mass bookkeeping
is formal.  Previous variation and AD estimates survive later steps by
subshading monotonicity.

/-- Positive-mass form of the joint finite iteration.

Every paper step is applied to the actual current refinement.  Re-entry at
the next scale needs that refinement to have positive mass, so this version
records positivity as an induction invariant.  It follows from the step's
mass inequality as soon as the left factor is positive. -/
