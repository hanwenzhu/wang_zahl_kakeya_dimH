# Fixed residue refinement for nearby coarse cells

Color `rho`-grid cells by their three coordinates modulo `3`.  Two points at
distance at most `rho` have grid indices differing by at most one in each
coordinate.  If their cells have the same residue, the indices are equal.
Keeping the heaviest of the 27 residue classes therefore upgrades same-cell
variation to a nearby-point estimate with only a fixed loss.
