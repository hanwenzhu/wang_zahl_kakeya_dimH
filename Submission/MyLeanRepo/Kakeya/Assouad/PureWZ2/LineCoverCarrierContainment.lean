# Cropped carrier containment from a strict paper line cover

At the caller scale used by the pure Node 3 route, the strict WZ line-cover
relation and the scale gap already force containment of the cropped full-line
paper carriers.  This is an internal bridge for the closed whole-cell
balancing infrastructure; it does not strengthen the public Section 6 cover.

If a radius-`delta` paper tube is strictly line-covered by a radius-`rho`
paper tube and `4 * delta ≤ rho`, then its cropped paper carrier is contained
in the parent carrier.

The `18 * delta ≤ rho` separation used by whole-cell balancing implies the
smaller scale gap needed by the carrier-containment bridge.
