# Direct-rich graph preparation on the saturated neighborhood

The graph carrier is the same-height saturation of the exact aggregate source.
It retains the saturation volume lower bound, while every point has a genuine
source witness at the same height.  These witnesses transfer all-height global
AD and fixed-line localization at graph scale `256 * rho`.
