# Dyadic uniformization of genuine side-rho cube heights

This is the finite combinatorial core of paper Step 3.  A nonempty family of
genuine side-`rho` cubes is refined by its literal center-height label.  Whole
height fibres are retained, their cardinalities become comparable within a
factor two, and only a logarithmic cardinality loss is paid.
