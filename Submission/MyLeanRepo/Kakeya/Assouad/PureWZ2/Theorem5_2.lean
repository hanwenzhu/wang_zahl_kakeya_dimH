# Pure WZ2 Theorem 5.2 assembly

This is the final WZ2-internal dependency boundary.  The conclusion is the
paper theorem in `PureWZ2Theorem5_2Statement`.  The Section 7
parameter-Frostman projection estimate is already available through a
sorry-free proof route and is a closed proof dependency, not a new node.

Node 8 in the serial heavy-task chain.

The proof may use the already closed theorem
`twisted_projection_parameter_frostman_estimate`, including its sorry-free
spacing/pruning and projected-fiber OS dependencies.  Node 8 itself has only
one open conclusion: the pure paper theorem.
