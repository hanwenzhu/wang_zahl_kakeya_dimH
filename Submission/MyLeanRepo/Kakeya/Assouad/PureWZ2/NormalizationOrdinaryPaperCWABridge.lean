# Ordinary-to-paper CWA bridge inside the canonical crop box

An ordinary unit-segment tube is contained in its coaxial paper tube as soon
as its ordinary carrier lies in the fixed paper crop box.  This removes the
remaining convention-change premise when a common rigid frame has already
placed every ordinary carrier inside that box.

The ordinary carrier lies in the corresponding cropped full-line paper
carrier whenever it already lies in the crop box.
