# CWA nearby-scales transfer through a covering

Transfer `WZ2PaperPureCWAAtNearbyScales` from an old (source) tube family to a
new (target) tube family related by a finite fiber covering.

## Strategy

Given:
- `oldFamily` at scale `δ`, `newFamily` at scale `δ'`
- `coverMap : Fin newFamily.card → Fin oldFamily.card`
- Each old tube has exactly `N` new tubes in its fiber
- Geometric hypotheses relating new tube carriers to old tube carriers

We transfer each component of `WZ2PaperPureCWAAtNearbyScales`:

1. **Finite error constant**: preserved (same or adjusted constant)
2. **Essentially distinct**: new tubes from different old fibers are separated
3. **Nearby scale cover data**: for each requested scale `rho₀`, map the old
   coarse family and partitioning cover to new ones.

### Cover data transfer

For each old scale-cover datum `(coarse, cover, uniform, rescaledFiber)`:
- Define a new coarse family (typically the same old coarse family, or a
  rescaled version depending on the geometric transformation)
- The new partitioning cover maps each new tube `i` to the same coarse parent
  as its source `coverMap i`
- Full fiber uniformity: the new fiber over a coarse parent has size
  `N × old_fiber_size`, so the uniform constant scales by `N`
- Rescaled fiber data: transfer through the nested covering

### Geometric hypotheses needed

The transfer requires:
- `h_cover_contain`: if `oldCarrier j ⊆ coarseCarrier k`, then
  `newCarrier i ⊆ coarseCarrier k` for all `i` with `coverMap i = j`
  (or containment in a slightly dilated coarse carrier)
- `h_distinct_fibers`: new tubes from different source fibers are not
  contained in each other's 2× dilations
- `h_dilated_disjoint`: doubled fibers remain disjoint under the transfer

These hypotheses are provided by the covering family construction.

Transfer a partitioning cover from old to new family.

Given an old partitioning cover `(oldFamily, coarse)`, define the new cover
by mapping each new tube to the same coarse parent as its source tube.

Requires: if `oldCarrier j ⊆ coarseCarrier k`, then `newCarrier i ⊆ coarseCarrier k`
for all `i` in the fiber of `j`.

Full fiber uniformity transfer.

If the new full fiber over each coarse parent has exactly `N` times the old
full fiber count (because each old tube contributes exactly `N` new tubes and
containment is preserved exactly), then the uniformity constant is preserved.

Requires both forward and reverse containment:
- Forward: old tube in coarse fiber → all its new tubes are in the coarse fiber
- Reverse: new tube in coarse fiber → its source is in the coarse fiber

A tube carrier is contained in its 2× centered dilation.

Proof: carrier is convex and contains its midpoint c. For any y in carrier,
x = (y+c)/2 is in carrier by convexity, and homothety(c,2)(x) = y.

Full fiber uniformity transfer via doubled-fiber disjointness.

Does NOT require pointwise reverse containment. Instead:
1. Old partitioning cover ⇒ every old tube in exactly one old full fiber
2. New doubled fibers disjoint ⇒ new full fibers pairwise disjoint
3. Forward containment ⇒ old tube in fiber k → all N new tubes in fiber k
4. Therefore new tube i in fiber k ⟺ old tube coverMap i in fiber k
5. Hence newFiber.card = N * oldFiber.card for every k
