# Removing the null top face of a paper shading

The Proposition 6.5 affine map sends the selected closed height interval to
the closed target window.  Removing the source top face loses no volume and
makes the target height interval half-open, which is compatible with the
fixed-origin half-open grid cubes used by the induced cubical shading.
