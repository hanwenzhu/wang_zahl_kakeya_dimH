# Slab expansion geometry for density+CWA cancellation

Given a slab W containing a point p from a tube's paper carrier, and a slab
normal n that is nearly perpendicular to the tube direction d (|inner(d,n)| ≤ K),
expand W by O(δ) to contain the FULL paper carrier of that tube.

Key estimate: for any q in the paper carrier,
|inner(q-p, n)| ≤ 12δ + (12δ + 2√3)·K

Proof:
- Extract axis line witnesses yp, yq within 6δ of p, q
- Both p,q ∈ axisBox, so dist(p,q) ≤ 2√3
- dist(yp,yq) ≤ dist(yp,p) + dist(p,q) + dist(q,yq) ≤ 6δ + 2√3 + 6δ = 12δ + 2√3
- |inner(yp-yq,n)| = |tp-tq|·|inner(d,n)| ≤ dist(yp,yq)·K ≤ (12δ+2√3)·K
- |inner(q-p,n)| ≤ |inner(q-yq,n)| + |inner(yq-yp,n)| + |inner(yp-p,n)|
                 ≤ 6δ + (12δ+2√3)K + 6δ

Slab expansion lemma: if a point p from a tube's paper carrier lies in a
slab centered at c with normal n and width w, and the tube direction d is
nearly perpendicular to n (|inner(d,n)| ≤ K), then the FULL paper carrier
lies in the expanded slab with width w + 12*δ + (12*δ + 2*Real.sqrt 3)*K.
