# Weighted selection for public centered distinctness

The public Definition 2.12 conflict relation is carrier containment in either
centered two-fold dilation.  This module applies the generic finite weighted
independent-set theorem directly to that relation.  It does not pass through
the volume-intersection predicate `DeltaTube.EssentiallyDistinct`.

A bounded public-centered conflict degree admits a public essentially
distinct subfamily retaining the corresponding fraction of paper shading
mass.  The output shading is the literal restriction along the selected tube
embedding.
