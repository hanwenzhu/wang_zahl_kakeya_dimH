# Inverse-transpose normal map for Lemma-8 local grains normalization

Constructs the normalized inverse-transpose of the anisotropic linear map DΦ
and proves its Lipschitz bound on unit vectors.

Given DΦ(v) = (v₀ + g_mid·v₁, K·v₁, S·v₂), the inverse transpose is:
(DΦ)^{-T}(w) = (w₀, -g_mid/K·w₀ + w₁/K, w₂/S)

## Key bounds

- Operator norm: ‖(DΦ)^{-T} w‖ ≤ √6/K · ‖w‖
- Lower bound on unit vectors: ‖(DΦ)^{-T} w‖ ≥ 1/(S+2)
- Normalized Lipschitz: ‖invTransNormal w₁ - invTransNormal w₂‖ ≤ 2√6(S+2)/K · ‖w₁ - w₂‖
