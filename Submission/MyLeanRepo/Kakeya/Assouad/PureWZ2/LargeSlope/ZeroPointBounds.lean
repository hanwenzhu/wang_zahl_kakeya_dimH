# Axis zero-point bounds under anisotropic rescaling

Given an original tube in the WZ1 paper line class, bound the x and y
coordinates of the anisotropically rescaled tube's axis zero point.

The rescaled zero point corresponds to the original axis point at height
z = c + (d-c)/2 (the midpoint of [c,d]), mapped through Φ.

Bounds:
- |x'| ≤ 14/3 (exactly what line_class_pigeonhole_selection needs)
- |y'| ≤ 7/150 (exactly what line_class_pigeonhole_selection needs)
