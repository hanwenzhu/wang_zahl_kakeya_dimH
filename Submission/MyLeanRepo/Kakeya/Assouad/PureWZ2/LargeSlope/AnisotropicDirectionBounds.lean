# Direction ratio bounds for anisotropic rescaling

Given a source direction `d` with `‖d‖ = 1` and `|d 2| ≥ 1/2`,
and anisotropic parameters `g_mid`, `K`, `S` with:
- `|g_mid| ≤ 1`
- `|K| ≤ 1/50`
- `S ≥ 50`

The rescaled direction `d' = normalize(DPhi(d))` satisfies:
- `|d' 0 / d' 2| ≤ 2/25`
- `|d' 1 / d' 2| ≤ 1/1250`

where `DPhi(v) = (v 0 + g_mid * v 1, K * v 1, S * v 2)`.
