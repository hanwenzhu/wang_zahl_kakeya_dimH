# Proposition 6.2 metric parents: upper-parent counting

This is the counting core of equation `prop62-upper-parent-cwa`.  A child
whose carrier lies in a convex region contributes its entire packet of fine
leaves to that region.  A common packet-cardinality floor therefore converts
the child count into a fine-leaf count before the ambient CWA is applied.

Cancel the common packet-cardinality floor in
`prop62-upper-parent-cwa`.

The three comparison factors have the literal paper meanings:

* `ambientToSelected` transfers the old ambient leaf packet to the final core;
* `degreeRatio` compares the upper and lower metric-packet cardinalities;
* `sourceConstant` is the old ancestor's normalized CWA constant.

Nat-cardinality form of the complete upper-parent CWA calculation.

It combines the packet-counting injection with the final-core and
factor-two packet-cardinality comparisons, but leaves all geometric set
definitions to the caller.

Upper-parent counting when the common cardinality floor is available only
after an explicit core-density loss:

`degreeFloor ≤ floorScale * #fiber`.

This is the literal form needed after the Proposition 6.2 augmented-tree
cleanup, where `degreeFloor = D_-` and `floorScale = θ⁻¹`.
