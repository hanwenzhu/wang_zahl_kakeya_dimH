# Convex-Wolff counting from a uniform body-volume floor

If every member of a finite body family has volume at least `floor`, then a
body contained in a convex test set forces that test set to have volume at
least `floor`.  Summing this elementary observation gives normalized
Convex-Wolff counting with constant `floor⁻¹`.

Equivalent denominator-free form: if `1 ≤ C * |body|` for every member, the
family satisfies normalized CWA with constant `C`.
