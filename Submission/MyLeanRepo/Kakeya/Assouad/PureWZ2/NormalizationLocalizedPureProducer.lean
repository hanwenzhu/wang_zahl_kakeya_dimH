# Localized pure producer for cropped critical normalization

The literal Definition 2.12 witness at one requested scale supplies an actual
nearby scale, complete strict fibers, and actual outer-John body CWA on each
fiber.  The centered/full-fiber machinery transports that one body CWA to a
common centered chart.  It does not by itself make the centered fiber an
all-scale `WZ2PaperPureIsExtremal` configuration.

The missing step is simultaneous localization and schedule regularization:
one must retain a localized subfamily and subshading while recovering
`WZ2PaperPureCWAAtNearbyScales` for every requested scale.  Moreover, the
historical nearby top-level theorem has the older line-class nearby API as
input.  In that older API the actual top-scale witness still satisfies
`rho ≤ 1`, so requesting scale `1` forces `rho = 1`.  Literal
`WZ2PaperPureNearbyScaleCoverData` deliberately has no type-level
`rho ≤ 1`; its actual witness for requested scale `1` may be larger than
`1`.  Consequently the literal pure nearby field does not currently imply
`WZ2PaperConvexWolffBound`.

This module records the thinnest conditional producer at that boundary.
It takes normalization exponent zero and uses the identity selection and
identity rigid frame.  Thus its only new input is a localized genuine pure
extremizer already in the fixed line class, together with the top-level CWA
on that same family.  The all-scale cropped pure CWA is then obtained by loss
weakening from `localized.extremal`; it is not replaced by a one-layer body
CWA.

The canonical cropped density and volume remain outside this module, in the
scalar producer.

Every pure extremal source supplies the literal actual-nearby witness at one
requested scale, and every parent of that witness has a nonempty complete
strict fiber.

This is the exact one-layer endpoint before all-scale-preserving
localization: after selecting or recentering one such fiber, Definition 2.12
does not automatically supply nearby witnesses for the new family at the
other requested scales.

The exact residual output of all-scale-preserving localization.

The type of `localized` already requires `WZ2PaperPureIsExtremal`; hence its
`cwa_nearby_scales` field quantifies over every requested scale.  The
additional fields record the geometric, density, and top-level CWA facts not
encoded by pure extremality.

All structural normalization fields follow from the residual input at
normalization exponent zero.

The ordinary selection is the whole localized family, the rigid frame is the
identity, and the cropped family is the same indexed family.  In particular,
the frame is common to every tube and the fixed line-class field is preserved
literally.

Quantifier-correct producer for the genuinely missing localized pure input.

The threshold is fixed before the source extremizer.  A proof may choose a
literal actual-nearby witness from `source.extremal.cwa_nearby_scales`, retain
complete strict fibers, use the centered/full-fiber machinery, and run the
finite schedule regularizer.  Its output must nevertheless be the all-scale
record above.  The one actual witness and its centered body CWA close only one
schedule layer; they do not supply the `∀ requested` field of
`localized.extremal.cwa_nearby_scales`.
