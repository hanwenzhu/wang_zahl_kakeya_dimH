# Frostman-to-John-rescaled Convex-Wolff conversion

This module proves the core mathematical conversion from a GWZ-style mass-based
Frostman condition on a fiber of fine tubes to a count-based Convex-Wolff bound
on the John-normalized affine images of those tubes.

Given a fiber of δ-tubes all contained in an A-dilated coarse carrier, and a
Frostman bound
```
containedMass(K) * |A-carrier| ≤ C * mass * |K|
```
for every convex K ⊆ A-carrier, the John-rescaled body family satisfies
```
containedCount(K) ≤ 27 * C * |K| * enmcard
```
for every convex K in normalized space.

The factor 27 comes from John's outer ellipsoid theorem: the outer John
ellipsoid has volume at most 27 times the body volume.

## Main results

* `wz2_unitBall_volume_ge_one`: the 3D unit ball has volume at least 1.
* `gwz_frostman_to_john_rescaled_convex_wolff`: the main conversion theorem.

/--
Convert a GWZ mass-based Frostman condition on a fiber subfamily to a
count-based Convex-Wolff bound on the John-rescaled body family.

The fiber tubes are all contained in the A-dilated coarse carrier.  The
Frostman condition applies to convex subsets of that carrier.  After John
normalization of the coarse tube, every convex test set in normalized space
is pulled back, intersected with the A-carrier, and fed to Frostman.  The
mass-to-count cancellation uses equal δ-tube volumes, and the geometric loss
is the John factor 27.
