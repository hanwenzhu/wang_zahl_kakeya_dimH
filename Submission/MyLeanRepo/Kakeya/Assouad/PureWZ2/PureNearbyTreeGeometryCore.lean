# Geometry core for the pure nearby-scale tree

Carrier containment of an ordinary tube controls the Hausdorff distance
between the two unit axis segments.  This is the geometric input needed to
compare independently chosen nearby-scale Definition 2.12 covers.

If an ordinary `delta`-tube carrier is contained in an ordinary `scale`-tube
carrier, every point of the fine unit segment is within `scale - delta` of
the coarse unit segment.
