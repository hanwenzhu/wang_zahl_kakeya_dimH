# A global internal representative of an interval-local C2 slope

Node 5 exposes only a function on `[-1,1]` together with an ambient function
which is C2 on that interval.  Downstream affine geometry uses the bundled
`SlopeFunction` type for convenience.  This file bridges the two without
strengthening the public Node-5 interface: a smooth cutoff makes the ambient
representative globally C2 and is identically one on the smaller interval
actually used by the construction.

/-- A genuine globally smooth representative of a paper slope.  Only the
values on the paper interval are identified with the originally chosen
ambient representative.  At the endpoints, the derivatives of the new
representative are the one-sided derivatives determined by `ContDiffOn`;
they need not equal Lean's ordinary derivative of the original ambient
function. -/
