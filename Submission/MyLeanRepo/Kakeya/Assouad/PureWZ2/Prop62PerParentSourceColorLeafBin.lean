# Proposition 6.2: per-parent source color and one global leaf bin

First choose one source color independently in every parent, paying only the
number of colors in total weight.  Then apply one global dyadic pigeonhole to
all leaves retained by those parentwise choices.  The final finset lives in the
ambient leaf type rather than a subtype, so it can be restricted further or
mapped back into any ambient source set containing `wholeLeaves`.
