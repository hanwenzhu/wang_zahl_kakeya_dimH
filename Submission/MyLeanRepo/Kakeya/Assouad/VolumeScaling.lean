Normalize a DeltaTube by scaling its midpoint by `c` while keeping direction
and using radius `c * δ`. The new unit segment is centered at `c • midpoint`.

For `0 < c ≤ 1`, the new tube carrier CONTAINS the homothety image of the original
carrier, because the original segment (length 1) scales to length `c`, while the
new segment has length 1 centered at the same midpoint.
