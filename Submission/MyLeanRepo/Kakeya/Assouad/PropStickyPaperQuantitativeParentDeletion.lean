# Quantitative whole-cell parent deletion

The existing termination theorem shows that the stabilized cell family is
nonempty when the deletion budget is smaller than the initial mass.  The
paper-level refinement also needs the quantitative charging estimate: the
total mass of all deleted cells is at most that same deletion budget.
