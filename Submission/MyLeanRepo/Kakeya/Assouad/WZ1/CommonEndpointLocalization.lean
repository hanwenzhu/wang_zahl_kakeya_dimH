# Paper localization for a common-endpoint projection graph

The final reduction from WZ1 Theorem 22 first removes edges whose first
vertex is too close to the origin or whose two endpoint vertices are too
close to one another.  It then pigeonholes the remaining graph into three
small planar grid cells.

This module records that literal operation.  In particular, the selected
vertex classes are the *active coordinate projections* of the selected
subgraph; no unused ambient vertices are inserted.  Quantitative removal,
Frostman normalization, and the later affine similarities are deliberately
left to separate modules.
