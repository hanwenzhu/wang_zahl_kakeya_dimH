# Angular factorization for Kaufman energy bound

Factorizes `max(|inner θ (x-y)|, δ)^(-γ)` into a radial part `‖x-y‖^(-γ)`
and an angular part `max(|inner θ v|, δ)^(-γ)`, where `v = (x-y)/‖x-y‖`.

The factorization holds when `‖x-y‖ ≤ 1`, which is the standard regime for
Frostman sets of diameter at most 1.

/-- Angular factorization inequality for distinct points.

Given unit vector θ, distinct points x, y with `‖x-y‖ ≤ 1`, and
`v = (x-y)/‖x-y‖`, we have:
`max(|inner θ (x-y)|, δ)^(-γ) ≤ ‖x-y‖^(-γ) * max(|inner θ v|, δ)^(-γ)`

The key step is `max(d*a, δ) ≥ d * max(a, δ)` when `0 < d ≤ 1`, which
reverses under the negative exponent `-γ`.
