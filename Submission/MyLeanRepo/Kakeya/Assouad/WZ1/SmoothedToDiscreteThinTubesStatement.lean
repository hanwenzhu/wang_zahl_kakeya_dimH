# Unsmoothing measure thin tubes at the original discrete scale

The OSW iteration is applied to measures smoothed at radius `delta / 10`,
while Lemma 40 consumes a discrete witness at scale `delta`.  These two
scales must remain distinct in the interface.

Recover a scale-`delta` discrete thin-tubes witness from thin tubes for the
measures smoothed at radius `delta / 10`.

The good finite relation consists of center pairs whose product smoothing
cell has at least one-half of its mass in the measure-level good set.  Markov
retains exceptional fraction `2 * c`.  For `r >= delta`, averaging the
measure tube bound over the source smoothing cell enlarges the tube radius by
at most `2 * (delta / 10)`, and the one-half threshold costs another factor
two.  The fixed constant `20` absorbs these losses for `0 <= beta <= 1`.
