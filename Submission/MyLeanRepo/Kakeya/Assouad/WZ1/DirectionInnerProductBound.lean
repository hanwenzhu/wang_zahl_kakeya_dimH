# Tight direction inner product bound from tube containment

If a fine tube is contained in a coarse tube of radius `tau ≤ 1/4`, then their
directions have projective inner product at least `sqrt(1 - 4*tau^2)`.

This is stronger than the `4*tau` norm bound from
`direction_closeness_from_containment`, and is the key estimate needed for
the WZ1 narrow vertical cone theorem.

Tighter transverse direction bound from full carrier containment.

If `Tδ.carrier ⊆ Uρ.carrier` with `0 ≤ δ ≤ ρ`, then the component of
`T.direction` perpendicular to `U.direction` has norm at most `2*(ρ - δ)`.

Proof: project onto a unit vector `v` perpendicular to `U.direction` in the
direction of `T.direction`'s transverse component. The functional
`x ↦ inner(x,v)` is constant on `U`'s segment and 1-Lipschitz, so its range
on `Uρ.carrier` has diameter at most `2ρ`. The points `T.base - δ•v` and
`T.base + T.direction + δ•v` are both in `Tδ.carrier`, and their `v`-values
differ by `‖transverse‖ + 2δ`.
