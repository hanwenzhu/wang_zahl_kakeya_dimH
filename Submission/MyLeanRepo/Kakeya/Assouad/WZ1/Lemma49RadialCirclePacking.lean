# Unit-circle cap packing for WZ1 Lemma 49

The radial image in the residual Kaufman branch lies on the unit circle.
Inside a ball of radius at most `1/2`, the tangential coordinate is bounded
by the cap radius and separates distinct radial directions up to the absolute
factor `sqrt 3 / 2`.  The resulting one-dimensional packing estimate is the
geometric input used to transfer Frostman control through radial projection.
