# WZ1 global grains from segment corrections

Closed proof of WZ1 Proposition 27: assemble compatible smooth segment
extensions into one normalized global grain direction.

/-- Zero-order bound for one segment extension on `[-1,1]`.

Pick a point one unit left of the expanded support where the extension vanishes,
then apply the global derivative bound (MVT) over the distance to any point in
the support.  The distance is at most `x₂ - x₁ + 2 * buffer + 1`, matching
`valueCost`. -/
