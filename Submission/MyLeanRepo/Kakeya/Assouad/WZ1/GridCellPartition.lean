# Grid cell partition for WZ1 balanced cover

A uniform grid partition of ℝ³ into cubes of side `s = 2*rho/√3`,
so each cube has diameter at most `2*rho`.

This module provides the grid side length, the grid index function,
and the key diameter and neighbor-count properties used by the
balanced cover's cell structure.

/-- The side length of a grid cube: `2*rho/√3`, chosen so the cube diameter is `2*rho`. -/
def gridSide (rho : ℝ) : ℝ := 2 * rho / Real.sqrt 3

/--
The grid index of a point at scale `rho`.

Two points with the same grid index lie in the same open-closed cube
of side `gridSide rho`.
-/
def rhoGridIndex (rho : ℝ) (p : Point3) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ :=
  gridIndex (gridSide rho) p

/--
If two points have the same grid index, their distance is at most `2*rho`.

Proof: each coordinate differs by strictly less than `gridSide rho`,
so the Euclidean distance is strictly less than `√3 * gridSide rho = 2*rho`.
