# WZ1 Lemma 44: heavy line packing estimate

Proof route:
1. **Geometric multiplicity bound** (`at_most_5_thickenings`): for fixed
   `p ∈ G₂`, at most 5 selected lines have `p` in their `r`-thickening.
   Unit normals are oriented so their cross product with `u = (p-base)/‖p-base‖`
   is positive; their inner products with `u` lie in `[-2r,2r]` and are pairwise
   separated by `5r/6`, so at most 5 fit in the interval.
2. **Combinatorial double counting** (`heavy_line_packing_from_multiplicity`):
   incidence sum and sum of squares bounded by `20·N²`; Cauchy–Schwarz plus
   heaviness gives `L ≤ 20/(K²·r^{1/2})`.

/-! ### Combinatorial double counting -/

/--
Combinatorial core of WZ1 Lemma 44.

If every `G₂` point lies in at most `20` selected strip thickenings, and every
selected strip is heavy (contains `> K * r^(1/4) * #G₂` points of `G₂`), then
`#lines ≤ 20 / (K^2 * r^(1/2))`.

Proof: double count incidences, bound the sum of squares by `20 * #G₂^2`,
and apply Cauchy-Schwarz.
