# ENNReal dyadic weight binning

Given finite weights, select a nonempty subfamily whose weights all lie in one
dyadic interval `[c, 2c]`, are above a minimum threshold, and retain at least
`1/bins` of the total mass after discarding low-weight elements.

The number of dyadic bins is `Nat.log 2 (2 * |α|) + 1`.

/--
Dyadic weight binning: discard elements below `total / (2 * |α|)`, then partition
the remainder into `Nat.log 2 (2 * |α|) + 1` dyadic bins and return the
maximum-mass bin.  The selected bin is nonempty, has all weights in `[c, 2c]`
for some `c > 0`, and retains at least `total / (2 * bins)` mass.
