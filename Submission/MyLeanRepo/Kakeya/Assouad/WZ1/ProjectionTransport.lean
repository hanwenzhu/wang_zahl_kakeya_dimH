If `A' = s • A` with `s ≥ 1`, then the line count of `A'` at width `delta`
(with base 0) is at most the line count of `A` at width `delta`.
The preimage strip has width `delta/s ≤ delta`, so monotonicity applies.

Combined scaling+translation transport for line counts.

If `A_norm = (s • A_cell) + t` with `s ≥ 1` and `A_cell ⊆ A`, then
the line count of `A_norm` at `(base, delta)` is bounded by the line count
of `A` at `(s⁻¹ • (base - t), delta)`.

This is the transport needed for Alternative A on the G₁/G₂ components.

Transport Alternative B back under independent dilation.
If `H'` is obtained from `H` by scaling F by `s_F` and G1/G2 by `s_G`,
then a dot-difference covering bound for `H'` implies one for `H`.

Requires `(s_F * s_G) * delta ≤ rho'` so that the scaled-down covering
radius `rho' / (s_F * s_G)` is still at least `delta`.

Transport Alternative B back under the affine triple transport.

Since `wz1AffineTriple` preserves dot-differences exactly (contragredient on F,
affine on G1/G2), the dot-difference set is unchanged and the same
`rho, center, radius` witness works for the original hypergraph.

Scale a Frostman set by `s ≥ 1` while preserving Frostman at the original scale `δ`.

For `r ≥ sδ`, use the standard scaling lemma (constant `C/s`).
For `δ ≤ r < sδ`, use the packing bound: the scaled set is `sδ`-separated,
so any ball of radius `r < sδ` contains at most 25 points.

Transport a dot-difference covering bound from a refined subgraph `H_ref` back to
the original graph `H`, via the scaled intermediate graph `H_scaled`.

The chain is `H_ref ⊆ H_scaled = H_cell.image(scale) ⊆ H.image(scale)` (since
`H_cell ⊆ H`).  We first boost the bound from `H_ref` to `H_scaled` by subset
monotonicity, apply `dot_diff_covering_transport` to descend from `H_scaled` to
`H_cell`, and finally boost from `H_cell` to `H`.

Like `dot_diff_covering_transport_subset`, but the scaled hypergraph includes a
translation `t_G` on the G components.  The translation cancels in the dot
difference `g₁ - g₂`, so the same covering transport goes through.
