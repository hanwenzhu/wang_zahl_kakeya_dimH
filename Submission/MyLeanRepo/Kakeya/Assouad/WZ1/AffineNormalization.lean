# Affine normalization for WZ1 removal of standard separation

Implements the paper's "final reduction" (Section 8, proof of Theorem 22'):
given KatzTao sets F, G₁, G₂ and a large tripartite graph H, restrict to
small grid cells, dilate independently, and obtain standard-separated Frostman
sets with a uniformly dense transformed graph.

## Main steps

1. Small-product vacuous B (existing lemma)
2. KatzTao to Frostman conversion (existing lemma)
3. Standard separation from geometric configuration
4. Grid partition and pigeonhole
5. Frostman and graph transport under dilation
6. Conclusion transport back

/-! ## Step 1: Standard separation construction -/

/--
Given three small sets with controlled positions, construct dilated/translated
sets satisfying `WZ1StandardSeparation` and contained in the unit ball.

Scaling choices:
- `s_F = 1 / (‖f_center‖ + r_F)`: F points have norm ≤ 1
- `s_G = 2 / (D_G + 2 * r_G)` where `D_G = dist g1_center g2_center`, translate G midpoint to 0: G points have norm ≤ 1

Ratio requirements:
- `‖f_center‖ ≥ 19 * r_F` (ensures F diameter ≤ 1/10 and dist ≥ 1/2)
- `D_G ≥ 38 * r_G` (ensures G diameter ≤ 1/10 and mutual separation ≥ 1/2)

/-! ## Step 2: Grid partition and pigeonhole -/

/--
Pigeonhole lemma for tripartite graphs: partition each vertex set by grid cells
of side `r`, and find a cell triple containing at least an average fraction of edges.

Returns the cell centers and the number of cell triples `N`, with the bound
`|H'| * N ≥ |H|`.

/--
Variant of `standard_separation_from_geometry` that guarantees scaling factors `s_F, s_G ≥ 1`.

When the geometry already satisfies the smallness conditions without scaling (cells small enough
and separation large enough), we use scaling factor 1. Otherwise we use the standard scaling.
