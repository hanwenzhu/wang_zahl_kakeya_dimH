# Self-centered spatial cover for WZ1 Lemma 18

The fine-to-coarse pullback enlarges one `sqrt rho` ball to
`sqrt rho + 4*rho`.  Under `4*rho ≤ sqrt rho`, this lies in a ball of radius
`2*sqrt rho`.

Local interval estimates must be centered at actual retained shaded points.
This module covers any subset of a radius-`2R` ball by at most `8^3 = 512`
balls of radius `R`, centered at points of the subset itself.

A subset of `B(center, 2R)` is covered by at most 512 radius-`R` balls whose
centers belong to the subset.
