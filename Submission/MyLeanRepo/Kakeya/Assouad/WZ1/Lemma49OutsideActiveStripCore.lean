# Direct outside-strip covering core for WZ1 Lemma 49

This module contains the finite packing argument used when one graph-active
first-coordinate vertex escapes the enlarged orthogonal strip.  Unlike the
retired monolithic proof, the strip-width hypothesis is imposed only on the
actual dense second-coordinate fiber of the graph.  Unused ambient vertices
of `G₁` play no role.
