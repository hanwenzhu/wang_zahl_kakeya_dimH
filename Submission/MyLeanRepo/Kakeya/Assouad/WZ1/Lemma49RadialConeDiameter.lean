# Radial cone diameter for WZ1 Lemma 49

Two source points lie in one narrow strip and stay on the same positive side
of a viewpoint.  If their normalized radial directions are close, then the
source points themselves are close.  This is the geometric injectivity and
local-fiber estimate used by the radial Frostman transport.
