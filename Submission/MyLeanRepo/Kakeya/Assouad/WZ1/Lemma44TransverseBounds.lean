# WZ1 Lemma 44: transverse strip-pair bound

The third case in the bad-pair triple count: a point far from the line through
two `G₁` points forces the associated strips to be transverse, so their
intersection lies in a small ball controlled by the Frostman bound on `G₂`.

## Case 3: b2 far from line(b1, b1'), strips intersect in a small region
-/

/--
Strip intersection geometry: given two lines with unit normals separated by θ,
their r-thickenings' intersection is contained in a closed ball of radius 6r/θ
around any point c that lies in both strips.

Uses bacon's `strip_intersection_subset_ball` and `thickening_subset_strip`.
The angle hypothesis is essential: without it (parallel lines), the intersection
can be an unbounded strip, so the statement would be false.

Per-strip-pair bound for Case 3: for fixed b1, b1', ℓ1, ℓ2, the G2 points
in the intersection of the two r-thickenings that are far from line(b1,b1')
are bounded by Frostman after strip intersection geometry.

Uses approximate angle bound + `stripIntersectionBall` + Frostman on G2.

Requires `8*r ≤ D*s` for a positive angle lower bound.
