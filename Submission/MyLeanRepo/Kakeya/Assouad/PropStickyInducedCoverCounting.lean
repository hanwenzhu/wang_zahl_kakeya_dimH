# Counting for induced recursive covers

When a coarser source fiber is partitioned into finer source fibers, the
number of finer parents is controlled by the ratio of the two source-fiber
cardinalities.  One `C` is spent on coarse-fiber uniformity and one on the
size range of the finer fibers.

If every child has mass in `[m, C*m]` and the total masses of two parent
blocks are `C`-comparable, then their child counts are `C^2`-comparable.
