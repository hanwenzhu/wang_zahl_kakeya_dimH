# Fixed-constant growth below the one-scale selected radius

The one-scale theorem selects

`rho > scale ^ (1 - epsilon ^ 2)`.

At sufficiently small `scale`, this is larger than any fixed multiple
`D * scale`.  The same arithmetic leaf is used with `D = 6` at every
nonterminal state and with `D = 6 * base` at the initial terminal grid,
whose mesh is only bounded by `base * delta`.

Absorb a fixed linear enlargement into the power gap between `scale` and
`scale ^ (1 - epsilon ^ 2)`.
