# Finite terminal-grid cover of the Section 7 projection rectangle

The normalized twisted projection is contained in
`[-51,51] × [-1,1]`.  At any positive integer grid scale, the floor index of
every point in this rectangle lies in an explicit finite integer box.  The
corresponding grid center has the same index, so its projected-fiber grid atom
contains the point.

The fixed projection rectangle is covered by the terminal grid atoms indexed
by `boundedPlanarGridCenters`.

The theorem is stated for an arbitrary subset `band` of the rectangle because
that is the exact premise consumed by projected-fiber atomization.
