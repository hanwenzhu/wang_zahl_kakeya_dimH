# Shaded mass as twisted-projection fiber multiplicity

The multiplicity pigeonholed in Section 7 is not the number of projected
tube images containing a planar point.  For an arbitrary shading, it is the
integral of the original spatial point multiplicity along the fiber of the
twisted projection.

For `q = (u,z)`, the fiber is parametrized by
`y ↦ (u - f(z)y, y, z)`.  The resulting triangular change of coordinates
has Jacobian of absolute value one, so integrating the fiber multiplicity
over the plane recovers the total shaded mass.

Fubini/coarea identity for the twisted projection.

The first conclusion is needed to form measurable dyadic bands in `Point2`.
The second says that those bands decompose the actual shaded mass, without
replacing arbitrary shaded pieces by complete tube projections.
