# Exact support of a projected-fiber pullback shading

Restricting a shading to the preimage of a measurable planar set always gives
one inclusion of twisted supports.  If the fiber-integrated multiplicity is
nonzero at every point of that planar set, the reverse inclusion also holds.

A measurable planar set on which `projectedFiberMultiplicity` is pointwise
nonzero is exactly the twisted union of its same-family pullback shading.

Pointwise nonzero fiber integral produces one fiber point with positive
spatial multiplicity, hence one original shaded carrier through that point.
This is stronger than an almost-everywhere support statement and is the form
needed for the retained dyadic bands, where a strict positive lower bound is
stored at every point.
