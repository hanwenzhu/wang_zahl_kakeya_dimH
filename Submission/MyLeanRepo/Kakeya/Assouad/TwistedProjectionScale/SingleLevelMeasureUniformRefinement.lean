# Single-level measure uniform refinement

Given a measurable set `Y` of finite positive measure and a finite disjoint
measurable cover `C` with at most `N` cells, produce a subfamily `S ⊆ C`
such that the occupied cells have pairwise comparable masses (within factor 2)
and at least a `1 / (2 * (Nat.log 2 (2*N) + 1))` fraction of the mass is retained.

Proof: discard light cells (below half the average positive mass), then
pigeonhole the heavy cells into dyadic mass classes with fixed base `R / (2*N)`.
