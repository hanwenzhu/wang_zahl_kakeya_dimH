# Globalize one local certificate across uniform finite cells

If a global measurable set is partitioned into finitely many comparable
positive cells, then a local subset supported on only a few cells controls
the thickening of the whole global set.  The total number of global cells
cancels between the global area and thickening estimates.

Cancellation-free finite-cell globalization.

`globalSet` is the disjoint union of the occupied cells.  Every two cell
areas are comparable by `R`, every cell has `rho`-thickening area at most
`V`, and `localSet` is contained in the union of at most `M` occupied cells.
If `L ≤ volume localSet`, then

`L * volume (cthickening rho globalSet) ≤
  R * M * V * volume globalSet`.

The statement avoids division and does not assume the total number of global
cells is known.
