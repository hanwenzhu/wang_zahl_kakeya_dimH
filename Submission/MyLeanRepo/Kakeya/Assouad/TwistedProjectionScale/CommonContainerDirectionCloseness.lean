# Direction closeness from tube containment

If a `rho`-tube T is contained in a `tau`-tube U, then their unoriented
directions are close: after choosing a sign ±1,
`‖T.direction - sign • U.direction‖ ≤ 4 * tau`.

This is a key geometric lemma for the common-container parameter cluster.

If a `rho`-tube T is contained in a `tau`-tube U, then there exists a sign
`sign ∈ {1, -1}` such that `‖T.direction - sign • U.direction‖ ≤ 4 * tau`.
