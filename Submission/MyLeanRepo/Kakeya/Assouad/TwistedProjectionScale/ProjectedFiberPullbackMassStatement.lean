# Mass of a measurable twisted-projection pullback

After selecting a measurable subset of the planar projected set, Section 7
pulls it back to every carrier of the original indexed family.  The retained
aggregate shaded mass is exactly the integral of the fiber multiplicity over
that planar subset.

Restricting a shading by a measurable planar set commutes with the
fiber-mass disintegration of the twisted projection.

This is an exact identity for arbitrary measurable shadings.  No compactness,
vertical-chart, parameter, or slope hypotheses are needed.
