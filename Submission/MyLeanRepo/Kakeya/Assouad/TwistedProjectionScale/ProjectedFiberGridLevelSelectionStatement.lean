# Match an arbitrary local scale to the projected-fiber grid tree

The OS tree has integer levels with mesh `base^(-level)`.  Once the terminal
mesh at level `levels + 1` is finer than `delta`, every intermediate scale
`rho ∈ [delta,1]` is comparable to the mesh at one tree level.

Select the first grid level whose mesh is at most `rho`.

The selected level lies in the OS tree and its mesh differs from `rho` by
less than one factor of `base`.  This is the scale bridge from
`ParameterLocalFullBlockData.blockScale` to same-level projected cell-area
uniformity.
