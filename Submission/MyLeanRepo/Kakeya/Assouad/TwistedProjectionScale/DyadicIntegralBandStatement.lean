# Dyadic pigeonholing by integral mass

A nonnegative measurable function can take arbitrarily small positive values,
so its positive range cannot be partitioned into finitely many dyadic bands
without first discarding a low-value tail.  On a finite-measure support, the
tail below `a` has integral at most `a * μ X`.  Once that is at most half of
the total integral and the function is bounded above by `a * 2^K`, one of the
remaining `K+1` dyadic bands retains a definite fraction of the integral.

Select one dyadic value band carrying a fixed fraction of the total
`lintegral`.

`X` contains the support of `g`.  The low tail costs at most half of the
integral, and `b ≤ a * 2^K` makes the remaining range a union of `K+1`
half-open bands.  The conclusion also records that the selected band lies
inside `X`, which is needed when it is pulled back to a same-family shading.
