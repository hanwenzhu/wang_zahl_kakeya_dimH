# Per-tube mass pruning for cropped paper shadings

This is the literal paper-model version of the first pruning in the proof of
`prop: sticky`: discard tubes whose shaded carrier has less than half the
average density scale.  The output is a genuine tube subfamily, not a shading
with empty carriers left on the ambient family.
