# Cardinality floor from the normalized Convex-Wolff inequality

This isolates the finite core of the paper remark:

> “If the elements of `S` are convex, then
> `#S ≥ C⁻¹ (inf_{S ∈ S} |S|)⁻¹`.”

For the cropped paper tubes used here, the geometric input is supplied as a
uniform carrier-volume upper bound `V`.  Applying the normalized
Convex-Wolff inequality to the carrier of one member gives
`1 ≤ C * V * #family`.
