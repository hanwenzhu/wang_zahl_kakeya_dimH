# Finite representative nearby-scale schedule

Choose a finite geometric schedule of requested scales and attach the
supplied nearby-scale witness at each representative.  Every admissible
requested scale is bounded by one representative actual scale, while two
applications of the ambient nearby-window constant fit inside the output
constant.
