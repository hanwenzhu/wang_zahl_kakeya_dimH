# Target: transformed cubical shading lies in its literal paper tube

Proof of `wz2_paper_literal_image_carrier`: every `delta / rho`-grid cube meeting
the literal affine image of a source set contained in one covered source paper tube
lies in the cropped target paper tube with the exact image axis.

## Proof outline

Given `p` in the cubical saturation at scale `eps = delta / rho`:
1. Pick `imagePoint` in the same grid cube, arising from `sourcePoint` in the source carrier.
2. **Axis neighborhood**: Find `q` on the source axis within `6 * delta` of `sourcePoint`.
   Its image `imageQ` lies on the target axis. The linear map norm bound gives
   `dist imagePoint imageQ ≤ 6 * delta / (100 * rho) = 0.06 * eps`. Combined with
   grid diameter `< 2 * eps`, we get `dist p imageQ < 6 * eps`.
3. **Crop bound**: Decompose `v = sourcePoint - z_anchor = w + t • d_source + u` where
   `‖w‖ ≤ 6*delta`, `|t| ≤ 5/2`, `‖u‖ ≤ rho/2`. Bound the perpendicular part and use
   the WZ2 literal coordinate bounds to show all image coordinates are small.
   Adding the grid offset `< 1/12` keeps `p` in `[-1,1]^3`.
