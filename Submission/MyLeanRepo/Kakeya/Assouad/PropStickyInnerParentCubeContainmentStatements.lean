# Coarse-cell containment from the actual paper parent

This is the literal geometry used while constructing the coarse shading in
the proof of WZ Proposition 3.2 and its WZ2 analogue:

> “if `Q` intersects `(1 / (2 n)) T_tilde`, then `Q` is contained in
> `T_tilde`.”

The current partitioning-cover API stores the equivalent quantitative
ingredients rather than an explicit same-axis inner tube.  A point in the
fine paper carrier lies within `18 * delta` of the fine axis at the same
height; the paper line-cover relation places that axis within `3 * rho` of
the coarse axis; and a side-`rho` cube has diameter less than `2 * rho`.
Thus `18 * delta ≤ rho` places the whole cube in the `6 * rho` neighborhood
of the coarse axis.  Crop-box containment is supplied separately because it
comes from the fact that the cube is an active paper cell.
