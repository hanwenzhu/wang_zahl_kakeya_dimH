# Quadratic-certified centered Taylor transport

The original centered Taylor transport statement records the copied jet and
relative metric distortion, but it does not characterize the two Taylor
tails.  Absolute-`C²` globalization must use the same transport witness for
cinematicity, graph transport, and the uniform bound.  This strengthened
statement therefore carries the pointwise quadratic-extension certificate
on that witness.
