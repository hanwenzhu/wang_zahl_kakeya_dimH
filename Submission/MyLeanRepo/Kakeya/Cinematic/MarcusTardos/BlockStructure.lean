# Block structure analysis for Marcus--Tardos

This module proves structural properties of blocks in cyclic
intersection-reverse sequences.

## Key results

- `posOf_sublist_lt`: relative order of `posOf` is preserved under sublists
- `IsIntersectionReverse.sublist`: sub-segments of IR sequences are IR
- `block_eq_drop_take`: dyadic blocks are drop-take segments
- `at_most_one_block_crosses_cut`: at most one block crosses a rotation cut
- `block_sublist_of_not_crossing`: non-crossing blocks are sublists of rotation
