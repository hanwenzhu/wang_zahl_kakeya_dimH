# Graph lenses for the PYZ application of Marcus--Tardos

This file records only the first-generation lenses lying in the graph strip.
The closing arcs used to turn the graphs into pseudo-circles are deliberately
absent from the data: the bridge theorem below is responsible for constructing
the cyclic intersection-reverse lists justified by that closing construction.

A finite graph family has the two pseudo-circle properties used by PYZ:
distinct graphs meet at most twice, and every meeting is proper.

Two graph lenses overlap exactly when they share a graph side over a
positive-length parameter interval.
