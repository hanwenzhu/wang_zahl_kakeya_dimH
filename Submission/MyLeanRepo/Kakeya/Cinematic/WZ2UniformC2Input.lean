# Absolute-two-jet-uniform PYZ export for WZ2

This is the corrected WZ2-facing boundary after the raw family-uniform
Theorem 1.7 API was disproved. The absolute jet bound is fixed before the
small-scale threshold and before the concrete family.

The uniform cinematic maximal estimate consumed by the WZ2 workstream.

The constants `C_KT`, `lambda`, and `M` respectively control the fixed
Katz--Tao loss, graph-neighborhood dilation, and absolute two-jet
normalization. Their placement before `epsilon`, `delta₀`, and `family`
matches the application-level normalization available in WZ2.
