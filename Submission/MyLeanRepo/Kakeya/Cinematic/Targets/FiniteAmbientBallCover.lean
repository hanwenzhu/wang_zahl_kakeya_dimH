# Finite bounded-overlap ambient ball cover

PYZ Section 5.1.1: after the first two-ends scale is frozen, choose radius-`t`
balls with centers forming a maximal strictly `t`-separated subset. Each cluster
`F ∩ 3B` has diameter at most `6t`, and the overlap sum is bounded by `D^3 * #F`
via iterated doubling and a packing injection.
