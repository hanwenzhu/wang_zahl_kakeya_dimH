Taylor quadratic lower bound: if `H` is twice differentiable and `H'' ≥ c`
on `[a,b]`, then for `x, y ∈ [a,b]`,
`H(x) ≥ H(y) + H'(y)(x-y) + c/2 · (x-y)²`.

Proof: set `K(z) := H(z) - c/2 · z²`. Then `K'' = H'' - c ≥ 0`, so `K` is
convex. The tangent-line inequality at `y` gives the result after algebra.
