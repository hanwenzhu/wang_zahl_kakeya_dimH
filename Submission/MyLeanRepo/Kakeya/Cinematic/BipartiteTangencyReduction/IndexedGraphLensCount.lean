# Count an indexed family of non-overlapping graph lenses

Given a finite index set `S` and an `S`-indexed family of graph lenses whose
sides lie in a fixed pseudo-circle curve family and whose distinct indices give
non-overlapping lenses, the Marcus--Tardos graph-lens bound controls `S.card`.

The proof is pure finite packaging: pairwise non-overlap forces the indexed lens
map to be injective, so its image finset has the same cardinality and inherits
the side-membership and non-overlap hypotheses required by the supplied bound.
