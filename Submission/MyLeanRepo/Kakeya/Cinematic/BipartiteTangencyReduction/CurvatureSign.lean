# Curvature sign lemma

Using the cinematic curvature gap and uniform derivative/value bounds,
show that h'' has constant sign and is bounded away from zero.

If |h| ≤ M, |h'| ≤ M' on [a,b], and the curvature gap gives
|h| + |h'| + |h''| ≥ d/K, with M + M' < d/K, then |h''| ≥ d/K - M - M' > 0
and h'' has constant sign on [a,b].
