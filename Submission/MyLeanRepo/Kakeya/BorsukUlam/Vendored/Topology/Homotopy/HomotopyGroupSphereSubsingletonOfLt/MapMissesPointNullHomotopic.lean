If a generalized loop `f : GenLoop N S^k x` misses some point `p : S^k` (i.e., `p` is not in
the range of `f`), and the basepoint `x` is also not equal to `p`, then `f` is homotopic
(relative to the boundary) to the constant loop at `x`.

Proof idea: The map `f` factors through the subspace `S^k \ {p}`, which is homeomorphic
to Euclidean space via stereographic projection. In Euclidean space, we can use the
straight-line (affine) homotopy to the constant map, which fixes points that are already
at the target value (such as the boundary points, which all map to `x`).
