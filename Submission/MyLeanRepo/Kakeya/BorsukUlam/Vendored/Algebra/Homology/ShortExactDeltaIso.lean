# Boundary isomorphism from short exact sequences

Given a short exact sequence of chain complexes `0 → X₁ → X₂ → X₃ → 0`
in an abelian category, if the middle complex `X₂` has trivial homology
in degrees `i` and `j` (with `j + 1 = i`), then the connecting
homomorphism `δ : H_i(X₃) → H_j(X₁)` is an isomorphism.

This is a direct consequence of the long exact sequence in homology
and is extracted into its own file for performance reasons: the
definition is much faster to type-check in a minimal context.

/-- **Boundary isomorphism from a short exact sequence of chain complexes.**

    Given `0 → X₁ → X₂ → X₃ → 0` exact, if `H_i(X₂) = 0` and `H_j(X₂) = 0`
    with `j + 1 = i`, then the connecting homomorphism gives an isomorphism
    `H_i(X₃) ≅ H_j(X₁)`. -/
