# Coefficient Rounding Lemma

If x and x' are within δ of each other, and A ⊆ [1,2], then the
δ-covering numbers of A + x·A and A + x'·A are comparable up to an
absolute constant factor (5).

## Main result

`coefficient_rounding`: `Nreal δ (A + x'·A) ≤ 5 * Nreal δ (A + x·A)`
when `|x - x'| ≤ δ` and `A ⊆ [1,2]`.

/-- **Coefficient rounding lemma.**

If `A ⊆ [1,2]` and `|x - x'| ≤ δ`, then the δ-covering number of
`A + x'·A` is at most 5 times that of `A + x·A`.

This allows rounding a coefficient `x'` from the thickened measure support
back to a grid coefficient `x` while losing only an absolute factor. -/
