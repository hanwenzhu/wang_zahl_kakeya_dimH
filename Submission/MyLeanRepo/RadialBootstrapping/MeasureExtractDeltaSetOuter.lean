  MeasureExtractDeltaSetOuter.lean

  Extract an IsDeltaSet from a measure with explicit ball growth and mass bounds,
  WITHOUT requiring the set E to be measurable.

  Uses measurable partition cells and the Carathéodory criterion
  (`measure_inter_add_sdiff`) to establish the additive partition identity
  for arbitrary E.

/-- Additive partition of an arbitrary set E by measurable, pairwise disjoint cells.

    If `V i` are measurable and pairwise disjoint, then for any `E` (not necessarily
    measurable), the measure of `E ∩ ⋃ i ∈ s, V i` equals the sum of `m (E ∩ V i)`.
    Proof uses the Carathéodory criterion: each measurable `V i` splits `E` additively. -/
