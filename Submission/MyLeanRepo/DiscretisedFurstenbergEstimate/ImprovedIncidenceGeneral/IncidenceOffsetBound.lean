  Offset bound and tube family boundedness from incidence.

  Given p ∈ closedBall 0 1 and p ∈ cthickening(δ, ℓ), proves:
  1. ‖ℓ.offset‖ ≤ 2 (for δ ≤ 1)
  2. Any family of lines all δ-near a bounded point set is bounded in AffineLine metric.

  These are needed to satisfy the hypotheses of construct_nice_configuration
  and extract_finite_tube_sset.
