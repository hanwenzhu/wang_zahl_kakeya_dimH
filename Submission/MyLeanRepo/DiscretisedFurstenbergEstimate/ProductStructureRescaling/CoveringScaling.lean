# Covering number scaling lemmas

This module proves two scaling facts for `Metric.externalCoveringNumber` used
in the product-structure rescaling theorem:

1. `externalCoveringNumber_smul`: covering numbers are invariant under positive
   scalar dilation in `EuclideanPlane`.
2. `smul_closedBall_inter`: the intersection of a dilated set with a closed ball
   equals the dilation of the intersection with a scaled ball.

Whiteprint node: `covering_scaling`.
