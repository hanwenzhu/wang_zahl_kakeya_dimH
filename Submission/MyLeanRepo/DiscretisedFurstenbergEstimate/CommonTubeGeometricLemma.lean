  Geometric lemma: a tube within 2δ of two points q, q' at distance d,
  with ‖q‖, ‖q'‖ ≤ 2, lies within 200*(δ + δ/d) of the unique line through q and q'.

  This is the bounded version of the `h_geom` hypothesis needed by
  `common_tubes_bound_proof`. The universal version (without ‖q‖ bound) is false
  because AffineLine.offset depends on distance from origin.

  Proof:
  1. Let p, p' be orthogonal projections of q, q' onto ℓ. Then ‖p-q‖, ‖p'-q'‖ ≤ 2δ.
  2. Direction: perpendicular component of q'-q relative to ℓ is (p-q)+(q'-p'),
     norm ≤ 4δ. Thus sin(angle) ≤ 4δ/d, giving ‖P_ℓ - P_ℓ₀‖ ≤ 8√2·δ/d.
  3. Offset: off_ℓ - off_ℓ₀ = (I-P_ℓ)(p-q) + (P_ℓ₀-P_ℓ)(q),
     bounded by 2δ + ‖P_ℓ-P_ℓ₀‖·‖q‖ ≤ 2δ + 16√2·δ/d.
  4. Total: ≤ 2δ + 24√2·δ/d ≤ 200(δ + δ/d).
