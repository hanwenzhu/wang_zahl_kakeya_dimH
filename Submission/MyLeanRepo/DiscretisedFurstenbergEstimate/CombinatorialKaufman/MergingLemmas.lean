  Merging helper lemmas for the Combinatorial Kaufman Decomposition.

  These lemmas adapt the helper results from MultiscaleDecomposition.lean
  to use the target definitions `chordSlope`, `chordValue`, `EpsilonLinear`,
  and `EpsilonSuperlinear`.

  Main results:
  - `chordSlope_convex`: weighted average formula for chord slopes
  - `largest_chordSlope_eq`: existence of largest point with given slope via IVT
  - `merged_epsilonSuperlinear`: merge superlinear prefix with linear suffix
  - `truncated_epsilonLinear`: truncate an ε-linear interval
  - `chordSlope0_gt_s_of_middle`: slope inference from convex combination
  - `merge_adjacent_epsilonSuperlinear`: merge two adjacent superlinear intervals
