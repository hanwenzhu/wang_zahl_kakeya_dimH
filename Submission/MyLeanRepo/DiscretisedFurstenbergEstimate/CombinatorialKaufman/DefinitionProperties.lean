# Properties of the core definitions for the Combinatorial Kaufman Decomposition

This module proves basic properties of `chordSlope`, `chordValue`,
`EpsilonLinear`, and `EpsilonSuperlinear`.

## Main results
- `EpsilonLinear.impSuperlinear`: `EpsilonLinear` implies `EpsilonSuperlinear`
- `chordValue_left`: `chordValue f a b a = f a`
- `chordValue_right`: `chordValue f a b b = f b` (when `a ≠ b`)
- `chordSlope_le_two`: chord slope ≤ 2 for 2-Lipschitz functions
- `chordSlope_nonneg`: chord slope ≥ 0 for monotone functions
- `chordSlope_convex`: chord slope over [a,b] is a weighted average of slopes over [a,x] and [x,b]
