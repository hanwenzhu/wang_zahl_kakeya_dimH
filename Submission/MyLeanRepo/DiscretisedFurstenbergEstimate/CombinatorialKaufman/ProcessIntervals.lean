# ProcessIntervals induction

Core combinatorial induction for the Kaufman decomposition.
Given δ²-linear intervals from tube-null, process right-to-left.
Each output interval is either 2δ-linear with slope ≥ s, or 2δ-superlinear with slope = s.

Includes the ExtendMerge sub-lemma for chain merging.
