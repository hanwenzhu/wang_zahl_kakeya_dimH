  Parameter budget lemmas for the discretised Furstenberg estimate.

  These lemmas establish the existence of positive exponents satisfying all
  constraints in the integration chain:
  - RKP feasibility (12ρ < t-s)
  - Combinatorial Kaufman feasibility (A_CK · ε_G < t-s)
  - Product axiom absorption (36·ε_N ≤ η and 36·ε_N < τ)
  - Final target exponent construction (ε_target = ε_G · η / 16)
  - Polylogarithmic loss absorption (log(1/δ)^C ≤ δ^{-ε})

For any real C > 0 and ε > 0, there exists δ₀ > 0 such that

polynomial decay. -/
