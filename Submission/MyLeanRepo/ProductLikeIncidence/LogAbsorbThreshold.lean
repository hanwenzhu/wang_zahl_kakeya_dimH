# Log Absorption Threshold Lemma

Derives `extractLogAbsorbHyp` from the standard asymptotic fact that
any power of log grows slower than any positive power of the variable.

## Key lemma

`log_pow_const_le_rpow`: for `C > 0` and `α > 0`, there exists `δ0 > 0`
such that for all `0 < δ ≤ δ0`:
  `C * (log(1/δ))^2 ≤ δ^(-α)`

## Proof

Set `x = 1/δ`. Use `general_log_pow_le_rpow 2 (α/2)` to get
`(log x)^2 ≤ x^(α/2)` for `x ≥ x0`. Then choose `x1 ≥ max(x0, C^(2/α))`
so that `C ≤ x^(α/2)`. Then:
  `C * (log x)^2 ≤ C * x^(α/2) ≤ x^(α/2) * x^(α/2) = x^α = δ^(-α)`.

## Dependency
