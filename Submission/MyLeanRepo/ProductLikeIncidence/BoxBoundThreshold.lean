# Box Bound Threshold (Production)

Proves the box-size threshold condition `hδ_box_small` for sufficiently
small dyadic scales, **uniformly in C**.

## Uniformity

The constant `C` is quantified inside the δ scope, with the bound
`C ≤ δ^(-η_work/2)`. This ensures δ₀ does not depend on C.

## Exponent calculation

Inside the τ-root: `42 * (35*C)^3 * 2^τ / δ^(η_work/2)`.
Given `C ≤ δ^(-η_work/2)`:
- `C^3 ≤ δ^(-3η_work/2)`, so `(35*C)^3 ≤ 35^3 * δ^(-3η_work/2)`
- Total inside root grows as `35^3 * δ^(-3η_work/2) * δ^(-η_work/2) = 35^3 * δ^(-2η_work)`
- After 1/τ root: growth exponent `2η_work/τ`, constant `(42*35^3*2^τ)^(1/τ)`
- `qBox = 4η_work/τ + η_work/100`
- Gap: `qBox - 2η_work/τ = 2η_work/τ + η_work/100 > 0`

The C-independent constant `(42*35^3*2^τ)^(1/τ)` is absorbed by the gap.

/-- Box-size threshold (uniform in C): for sufficiently small δ, and any
`C` satisfying `C ≤ δ^(-η_work/2)`, the box expression is bounded by
`δ^(-qBox η_work τ)`. This discharges the `hδ_box_small` hypothesis of
`phase0_threshold_wiring_v3`. -/
