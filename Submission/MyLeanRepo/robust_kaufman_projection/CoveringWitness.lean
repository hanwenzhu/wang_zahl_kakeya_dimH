# Covering witness for bounded sets in ℝ

Given a bounded set `A ⊂ ℝ` and `δ > 0`, constructs a strictly `2δ`-separated
subset `R ⊆ A` whose cardinality equals the `δ`-external covering number of `A`.

Uses a greedy infimum sequence from left to right, then backward perturbation
to extract points in A with strict 2δ-separation and exact covering cardinality.
