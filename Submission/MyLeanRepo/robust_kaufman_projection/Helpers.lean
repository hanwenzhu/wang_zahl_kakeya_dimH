# Helper lemmas for the robust Kaufman projection theorem

This module provides three supporting results:
1. `affineProjection_lipschitz`: the affine projection is 2-Lipschitz for |σ| ≤ 1.
2. `ncover_eq_card_of_two_delta_separated`: for a finite strictly `2*δ`-separated set
   in `ℝ`, the `δ`-external covering number equals the cardinality.
3. `InUnitSquare.bounded`: any subset of the unit square is bounded.
