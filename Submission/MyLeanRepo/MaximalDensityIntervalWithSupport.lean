# Maximal Density Interval with Support Endpoint

Strengthened version of `maximal_density_interval_C` that guarantees
the left endpoint `x₀` lies in `μ.support`.

If the convex hull of `μ.support ∩ I₀` has length ≥ δ, the original maximizer
already has its left endpoint in the support.  Otherwise the support is
concentrated in a sub-interval of length < δ; we shift to `[a, a+δ]` starting
at the leftmost support point `a`, which has length δ, so the self-similarity
condition is trivial.
